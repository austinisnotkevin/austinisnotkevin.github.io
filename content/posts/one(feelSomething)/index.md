## A Place to Feel Something
I feel as if blogging is the thing to do as an artist struggling with your identity, or lack of output, or lack of time to craft, or blah blah blah. I hate that I feel this way a little bit, because it makes me feel just as old as I am. While it doesn't make me feel any older than that, it does greet me with a breathy sigh. I fucking hate being told what to do (suck it up and let obligation fill your time), and I hate when it's the only option (especially when I *want* to do it because it means better for the family).

If you stop scrolling, make it just after the next carousel, which is photos of downtown Dayton lately.

## A fundamental lack of personal art.
Not everything is about me and my lack of output on this. Some of the blame is on the system in which we live. we live in a structured hellscape that means we don't get the same things our grandparents did. we don't get third places. we don't get free spaces for art and performance. we don't get loans or houses or financial comfort as soon as we enter the workforce. Everything is harder, and we are harder workers and hustlers for it. 

Keep grinding. Keep making art, especially when it's hard. Especially when you'd rather die. The most punk rock thing we can do is keep making shit when we aren't supposed to have enough in the tank to accomplish any more than working our 9-5.

## Quisque ultricies
Quisque ultricies tincidunt sem nec tincidunt. Aenean nibh diam, dapibus varius ornare nec, suscipit ut arcu. Integer ut elit sollicitudin, fermentum ipsum nec, tempus eros. Donec hendrerit facilisis maximus. Pellentesque eu mi ipsum. Vivamus diam tellus, varius sed dolor at, finibus tempus lorem. Morbi sed mauris quis enim vehicula hendrerit. Sed et sollicitudin est. Maecenas scelerisque ligula ac purus gravida, et feugiat nibh blandit. Integer id quam ac arcu convallis interdum eget sed libero. Aliquam varius est quis efficitur efficitur. Cras id turpis magna. Aenean cursus, libero auctor ullamcorper vestibulum, nisl risus consectetur nisi, ut molestie enim libero sed ipsum.

## Etiam sollicitudin
You thought I left the last block as an accident, didn't you?
