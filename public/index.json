I hate that I feel this way a little bit, because it makes me feel just as old as I am. While it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me feel any older than that, it does greet me with a breathy sigh. I fucking hate being told what to do (suck it up and let obligation fill your time), and I hate when it\u0026rsquo;s the only option (especially when I want to do it because it means better for the family).\nIf you stop scrolling, make it just after the next carousel, which is photos of downtown Dayton lately.\nView this post on Instagram A fundamental lack of personal art. # Not everything is about me and my lack of output on this. Some of the blame is on the system in which we live. we live in a structured hellscape that means we don\u0026rsquo;t get the same things our grandparents did. we don\u0026rsquo;t get third places. we don\u0026rsquo;t get free spaces for art and performance. we don\u0026rsquo;t get loans or houses or financial comfort as soon as we enter the workforce. Everything is harder, and we are harder workers and hustlers for it.\nKeep grinding. Keep making art, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s hard. Especially when you\u0026rsquo;d rather die. The most punk rock thing we can do is keep making shit when we aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to have enough in the tank to accomplish any more than working our 9-5.\nQuisque ultricies # Quisque ultricies tincidunt sem nec tincidunt.
