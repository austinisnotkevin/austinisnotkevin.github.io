Whether or not the art is worth making, or the statement worth stating, or the photo worthy of attention.\nI feel as if it\u0026rsquo;s time to resolve those feelings and get over it. So, to start the adventure, let\u0026rsquo;s make a few websites.\nPART of the problem is that I am not afraid to reverse engineer something already built, but I am not very good at programming in the first place. I\u0026rsquo;m a network engineer, a photographer, what I am NOT, is a web developer. Keeping that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s keep it simple, robust within its means, and something that is responsive.\nThe Solution # I\u0026rsquo;ve made a handful of decisions. One is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to scale your website to serve hundreds of thousands of customers. Two is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need e-commerce. Three is that you want something to set and forget, maybe a blogging platform.\nCaddy # Caddy is our web server of choice. This will make it easy to point to the different instances of Hugo.\nTK - install caddy Hugo # Hugo is our website builder. There\u0026rsquo;s not much to talk about other than it\u0026rsquo;s the best static website builder I\u0026rsquo;ve found in recent history.\n","date":"29 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/twomakesomething/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eA Place to Make Things \n    \u003cdiv id=\"a-place-to-make-things\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#a-place-to-make-things\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eThe Problem \n    \u003cdiv id=\"the-problem\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#the-problem\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a struggle inside my brain any time I decide it\u0026rsquo;s time to make things.

I hate that I feel this way a little bit, because it makes me feel just as old as I am. While it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me feel any older than that, it does greet me with a breathy sigh. I fucking hate being told what to do (suck it up and let obligation fill your time), and I hate when it\u0026rsquo;s the only option (especially when I want to do it because it means better for the family).\nIf you stop scrolling, make it just after the next carousel, which is photos of downtown Dayton lately.\nView this post on Instagram A fundamental lack of personal art. # Not everything is about me and my lack of output on this. Some of the blame is on the system in which we live. we live in a structured hellscape that means we don\u0026rsquo;t get the same things our grandparents did. we don\u0026rsquo;t get third places. we don\u0026rsquo;t get free spaces for art and performance. we don\u0026rsquo;t get loans or houses or financial comfort as soon as we enter the workforce. Everything is harder, and we are harder workers and hustlers for it.\nKeep grinding. Keep making art, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s hard. Especially when you\u0026rsquo;d rather die. The most punk rock thing we can do is keep making shit when we aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to have enough in the tank to accomplish any more than working our 9-5.\nQuisque ultricies # Quisque ultricies tincidunt sem nec tincidunt.
